# Robot_design_project
This is a project completely developed by me on my own for a Microcontrollers and Embedded Systems course of my ECE Bachelor's. It contains the design of a PCB and the complete programming of a microcontroller for designing a fully operational robot that had different action modes, including manual and automatic operation modes.
